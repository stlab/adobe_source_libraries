\par November 4, 2010 ASL - 1.0.43 Release

This release is source only, no binary packages and no net setup scripts.

I've recently returned to Adobe as architect for mobile imaging applications.
The Software Technology Lab remains a "virtual group." We have a collection
of improvements, fixes, updates, and additions that we've gathered over the last
year and a half since the last release. We are working to simplify the release
process to something more managable and to get back to more frequent releases.
That is why we've dropped the binary distribution and net setup scripts.
Suggestions for further simplification welcome.

A huge thanks to Foster and Mat who have continued to contribute to the libraries.
Thanks much for your continued support!

 Sean

Highlights of this release include:
    ASL:
        - Updated projects to support Boost 1.44.0
        - Simplified move library. Removed move_sink and copy_sink in favor of
            always using RVO.
        - Added the "to" token ("->") to the lexer
        - Added support for hexadecimal numbers to the lexer (0xDEADBEEF,
            0xffe0, etc.)
        - Removed gil from ASL (clients can use boost version instead)
        - Added support for gcc 4.5.0 with -std=C++0x.
        - Updated to Visual Studio 2010, older versions not supported.
        - Extended the dancing links algorithm to include colorized nodes;
            updated test cases as well.
        - gcc 4.2 and OS X 10.5 SDK support (deprecated function warnings
            selectively disabled).
        - Replaced of basic_sheet_t with sheet_t in layouts and associated Eve
            grammar updates.
        - New external_model_t with support for cell creation in Adam parser.
        - once.hpp fix (Thanks John (Eljay) Love-Jensen)
        - Added support for overriding the index operator in the virtual machine.
        - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

        - Property model library

            Added support for multi-out relate terms. For example:
            ---
            logic:
                relate {
                    x, y <== [a, b];
                    a, b <== [x, y];
                }
            ---
            The rhs value must be an array with the same arity as the number of
            cells named on the left. A cell can appear more than once on the
            left so long as the term can be uniquely selected.

    User supported libs (APL):
        - Binary file format debugger (bffd) submitted

\par May 13, 2009 ASL - 1.0.42 Release

Highlights of this release include:
        - Property model library (Adam)
            - Changed filters (self referential expression on an interface cell)
              so they aren't ignored when the cell is derived from a relate clause
              (see \ref asl_release_notes for details).
        	- Fixed issue introduced in 1.0.41 with incorrect poison set being
        	    calculated for invariants.
	        - Reworked invariant cells they now behave more like output cells
	          and can be refered to in expressions.
	        - Updated the image_size example to demonstrate an ignored/disabled
	          control (resample method when not resampling).
        - Some 64 bit fixes and cleanup.
        - Minor cleanup, performance improvements and bug fixes.


\par February 13, 2009 ASL - 1.0.41 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - Property model library (Adam) - rewrote main solver
	        - no longer uses exceptions as flow control.
	        - fixed bug with initializers that refer to cells with
              define_expressions has causing the define_expressions to evaluate
              which could refer to cells which had not been declared.
	        - exported get() member, it is now the client responsibility to wire
              sheet_t::get() to the variable lookup in the VM (this also allows the
              clients to hook the variable lookup for supporting custom variables).
              In the future the VM will be separated entirely from the property
              model library.
	        - added some more error reporting including reporting duplicate cell
              names.
        - virtual machine library
            - removed the contributing buts which were tracked through
              calculations. The VM stack is now just a stack of any_regular_t.
            - removed the use of storing size_t in an any_regular_t in the VM
              (was breaking serialization among other things because size_t is not a
              C++ basic type on Win64).
        - any_regular_t
            - improved serialization by removing one heap alloc/dealloc per item
              serialized, also uses logN search for type instead of linear search.
                - removed the hack to handle size_t serialization on Win64.
            - serialization will now throw an exception when it encounters a
              type other than one of the 7 CEL types (it used to assert).
            - in debug builds, the version field of the any_regular_t vtable
              contains a short type name for debugging purposes only.
              See the <a href='http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Debugging_any_regular_t_and_short_names'>
              wiki documentation.</a>

\par December 23, 2008 ASL - 1.0.40 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - The pmeval (property model evaluator) interpreter is ready
          for general purpose use. It has been enhanced to allow
          flexible exploration and testing of property models.
          Commands include check assertions, print statements, update,
          reinitialize, and property model dumps (showing enablement,
          contributing/intent). pmeval can be built from source (all
          platforms, including cygwinand *N*X) or downloaded from
          sourceforge for Mac or Windows.
        - Property models can also be evaluated via an experimental
          web form-based interface to pmeval.  The service, along with
          an intermediate property modeling tutorial is available
          through http://emarcus.org/#pmeval .
        - Rewrote enablement for the property model engine.  Enabled
          status is set to a conservative approximation of enablement
          detection (erring towards enablement): it is set to false if
          a change to the cell cannot affect the output of a correct
          sheet, and true if it *may* effect the output.
        - Replaced monitor_active with monitor_enabled (conservative
          enablement, touch_set support).  See the documentation for
          monitor_enabled in adam.hpp, and the calls to
          monitor_enabled in (APL's) widget_factory.hpp for details.
          (Note that it is incorrect to unconditionally pass NULLs to
          monitor_enabled.  The bug will manifest as incorrect
          enablement behavior in the presence of touch sets in eve
          sheets.)
        - Fixed bug where interface cells appearing in a when clause
	      condition were not contributing.
        - New papers and presnetations at
          http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Papers_and_Presentations
        - Patched boost to allow preservation of test targets (now the
          default).
        - Patched to serializes std::size_t on MSVC when compiling for
          64 bit architecture.
        - Added qualification to binary_search algorithm to remove
          ambiguity.
        - Refactored pmeval, introduced (test-only) queryable_sheet_t.
          pmeval now supports multiple input files, sheet separate
          from commands, multiple simultaneous sheets.
        - Allow monitoring of invariants under monitor_value.
        - Improved release notes and build scripts for *N*X/cygwin

    User supported libs (APL):

        - Updated widget factory so that widgets monitor_considered
          instead of monitor_active, to properly enable in presence of
          touch sets.
        - Fixed reveal widget bug
        - Update so that both stlab and internal adobe frameworks can
          leverage widget_factory.hpp; also rolled in updates from
          other teams within adobe

\par November 6, 2008 ASL - 1.0.39 Release

    ASL:
        - Added sheet_t::reinitialize(). "Input cells are
          re-initialized, in sheet order, and interface cell
          initializers are re-evaluated. Priorities are updated, but
          no callbacks are triggered. Calls to reinitialize should be
          followed by calls to update must be called, just as if the
          cells were updated by set operations on sorted ranges."
        - Adam documentaion improvements
        - Updated to (patched) boost 1.37.0
        - Added a command line property model evaluator tool, and
          programmer-oriented tutorial at:
          http://easyurl.net/pm_tutorial
        - New (theoretical) paper on Property Models from ACM GPCE
          2008 added to: http://easyurl.net/stlab_publications
        - Regressions now also run under Vista 64-bit
        - Regressions now also run under Mac OS X 64-bit
        - Deprecated pin library. Replaced with clamp library. Also
          added median(of 3) and some select algorithms.

    User supported libs (APL):
        - Formatter improvements.

\par September 10, 2008 ASL - 1.0.38 Release

        - Updated to intel tbb 2.1 (tbb21_009oss)
	    - Fix 64-bit poly_test issue
        - Fixes for identity<> and pointer_to<> and their use.
        - Eliminated concept macros
        - Minor fix for static_table.hpp to include stdexcept
        - Fix for lexer to allow keywords as names, i.e. @empty.
        - Fix for MSVC compiler warning in memory.hpp (from Jon
           Clauson)
        - Predicates for conditional relate declarations are now
          calculated up-front and cannot be dependent themselves on a
          relate declaration.
        - Raising limit on number of interface cells to 256.
        - Added parameter to final to avoid misuse.
    	- Added -L to curl commands in net setup scripts to protect
          against redirects
        - Made selection_t equality_comparable
        - Added bool has_input(name) and bool has_output(name) to the
          property model library.
        - removed outdated expression_filter routines; updated
          adam_tutorial output format; deleting some unnecessary
          sources
        - Cleaned out static intializers
        - Collapsed entity lookup to a single place -- removed the
          once stuff from xml_parser
        - Fixed issue with implicit casts of enum node state in
          closed_hash.hpp
	    - Fixed bug in property model library where an active monitor
          wasn't called on connect.
	    - Added code to layout library to reset metrics prior to
          calling client measure function to avoid errors where client
          code assumes defaulted value.
        - Fixed bug with active monitor not being called on connection
          in Adam.

    User supported libs (APL):
        - Improvements to the expression, property model, and layout
          formatters. they print are much more readably now,
          especially with arrays and dictionaries with many items.
	    - Added shift as a modifier key to the new modifier key
          functionality
	    - Move controller and view concepts (compile and runtime) to
          APL
	    - BBedit language modules
        - xml_to_forest test app
        - Added xml_element_forest, a utility header that round-trips
          an XML file to a forest of dictionaries; also gives the user
          the ability to hand-generate a forest of dictionaries with a
          specific format and stream out a resulting XML file.
	    - Moved functions_as_controller to widget_proxies.hpp in APL
	    - Renamed to_utf* to value_to_utf* in the singleton code point
        - Removed subview factory
 	    - Gave behaviors the ability to have their verbs pointed to
          another callback once they've been established. This gives
          clients the ability to do more than just resize the eve layout
          at the appropriate time (e.g., to resize a parent container
          not managed by eve.)
 	    - sequence_model and associated view and controller concepts
          and implementations. Multiple changes and to improve the
          overall mvc architecture of the system. Also added a
          multiplexer/demultiplexer system to allow for the routing of
          commands between the sequence_model and any attached
          sequence views and controllers.
        - dictionary_set migration from obscure widgets lib location
          to APL
        - Added breakpoint-compatible formatting to some of the
          casting type checks
	    - Logic fix for one of the selection algorithms
        - Fixed error reporting code in Begin.
	    - Added formatter_tokens to eliminate duplicate symbols when
          both formatters are included in a single project
	    - Cleaned up a lot of the serialization code, pulled out
          dynamic memory allocations, etc
	    - Added expression_filter, for the escaping and unescaping of
          xml entities in a string; useful for serialization work
	    - Fixed some of the image_t leaks under win32. Problems run
	      deeper though, since the architecture fails to store
	      platform resources for cleanup when bitmaps updated or when
	      window closes. Deeper fixes will be required to plug the
	      rest of the leaks
        - Added the ability to add 'raw' functions to the function
          pack, bypassing all the function pack magic in case you'd like
          to do the work yourself.
        - Update example code. inlined some function_pack routines,
          and added an nbitpath helper routine to the bitpath structure

\par May 5, 2008 - ASL 1.0.37 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - Update ASL to depend on boost 1.35.0
        - Patch boost 1.35.0 to fix bugs in boost threads and boost
          filesystem
        - Patch boost build to add a link-incompatible feature
          allowing _SECURE_SCL to be disabled, thus avoiding
          unjustifiable performance penalty on release builds.
        - Multiple net setup and build improvements.
        - Workaround the bjam MkDir bug that was causing build errors
          and the need for multiple invocations of bjam.
        - Tested against gcc 4.3.0.
        - Update ASL to depend on Intel Thread Building Blocks
          2008.04.08 stable release, now supporting atomics under ppc 32bit.

          mechanism. Remove function_as_view since function/bind
          results can once again be used directly. poly_view is now
          optional for clients who find it more convenient.
        - Change adam API to remove
          attach_controller/detach_controller in favor of signals
          mechanism. poly_controller is now optional for clients who
          find it convenient.
        - Remove dependence of adam_tutorial on APL and move to
          ASL. Add visual project for adam_tutorial.
        - Rewrite copy_on_write to use a well-defined binary
          representation, add custom allocator support, move to
          version1 namespace.
        - Added script to update a directory in p4 based on "offline"
          changes, and other scripts to automate documentation update
          process.
        - Fixes to vector and string for windows min/max problems,
          thanks to Jesper.
        - Add check ensuring operator== interoperability of forest
          iters and const iters.

    APL:
        - Add property_model_formatter.hpp and layout_formatter.hpp
          for parsing layout and property model descriptions into a
          data structure instead of to the widget factory.
        - Add layout_tidy and property_model_tidy which check layout
          and property model definitions validity.

\par March 21, 2008 - ASL 1.0.36 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - version_1 types (replace version_0 types) - better, defined binary
        layout and carry allocator for applications with replaced new/delete.
	    - capture_allocator, an std::allocator compatible allocator which
	    carries a paired new/delete.
	    - Allocator support in closed_hash_set<>, closed_hash_map<>, and
	    vector<>.
	    - Vastly improved move library (Thanks to Dave Abrahams!).
	    - Vastly improved copy-on-write library (now uses move library to
	    reduce number of increment/decrements).
        - Bug fix in layout library that caused containers with the width
        driven by the frame width to layout children incorrectly.
        - Bug fix in forest::erase where the beginning of the erased range has
        a lower depth then the end of the range.
        - Forest test cases and minor fixes to forest types.
        - Misc bug fixes.
        - Fixes to build and distribution tools.
        - Fixed search on documentation site to point to stlab and not
        opensource domain.

\par January 28, 2008 - ASL 1.0.35 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - More property model library simplifications and the removal
        of "weak" which never worked.
        - Bug fix for copy-on-write assignment which was leaking.
        - Work on runtime_cast<> for any_regular_t.
        - Fixed a bug with edit_number and disabled items with multiple units.
        - Fixed a bug with image_size (introduced in some recent cleanup).
        - removed adobe/algorithm/assign.hpp
        - improved rvalue assignment in some classes
        - renamed copy_bound to copy_bounded
        - minor improvements to operator+() for strings
        - updated doxyfile for latest doxygen
        - More algorithm documentation clean-up. Greately improved erase/erase_if
        container algorithms and container storage type function.
        - Templatize erase_if test cases
        - Initial work on forest unit_test


\par January 3, 2008 - ASL 1.0.34 Release

Highlights of this release include:

    ASL:
        - Lots of clean up and removed defered initialization of
        property model cells.
        - changes to the initializers for the property model library
        you must now call upate() prior to monitoring or attaching a
        view (you'll get an assert if you don't) and the monitor
        function (or view) is called immeditely when attached with the
        current state.
        - support for stateful function object (hash, key function,
        and compare) to closed_hash_set
        - hash_index class which is similar to table_index but
        implemented with a hash_set instead of a vector -
        there is stills some room here to generalize the two.
        -  Changed ordering in compressed_pair so it actually
        compresses on Windows
        - GIL: Makefile and documentation fixes. Intel fixes.


\par December 12, 2007 - opensource.adobe.com moving to stlab.adobe.com
Adobe's Software Technology Lab has moved to a new domain, stlab.adobe.com. The main website is now at http://stlab.adobe.com . Please update any references/bookmarks to our site.

\par September 6, 2007 - ASL 1.0.31 Release

Highlights of this release include:
    - Major refactoring of the libraries (and supporting scripts/projects, etc.) so that adobe_source_libraries (ASL/GIL), adobe_platform_libraries (APL), and boost_libraries (Boost) are all peers at the top level directory. In upcoming releases we will be focusing on "completing" the core ASL portion of the library, with full documentation and test suites. ASL contains the layout engine, property model, algorithms, poly library and other components.  APL contains the "platform" widget code and other miscellaneous pieces. APL depends on ASL depends on Boost.
    - For more information and changes see the \ref asl_release_notes.

\par August 2, 2007 - ASL 1.0.30 Release

\par July 5, 2007 - ASL 1.0.29 Release

Highlights of this release include:
    - This release is mostly to pickup bug fixes (including some for 64 bit Windows), a few string additions to version_0::string_t, removal of const_once_name_t, and GIL 2.1. Vacations and the holiday got in the way of a richer release.
    - For more information and more changes see the \ref asl_release_notes.

\par June 14, 2007 - ASL 1.0.28 Released

Highlights of this release include:
    - Pardon our dust with this release. We've been very busy with the version_0 libraries and believe the code is complete but not all the docs are in place yet. We'll be continue that work for 1.0.29. See the  \ref asl_release_notes for an overview of what libraries are in version_0. <em>Always feel free to ask questions on the forums - until the docs are complete for version_0 there may be a few more questions than usual but we're always happy to answer and questions help improve our documentation. -- Sean</em>

    - Lots of work to make it easier to define widgets and connect them up and improvements to the image widget.
    - We've started work on a \c version_0 library which will contain a collection of containers and types with well defined binary representations. These form the basis for supportable dynamic library interfaces but the types will also be usable on their own. Check out the new \c adobe/vector.hpp and \c adobe/closed_hash.hpp. More info to come in the 1.0.28 release.
    - New algorithm - \c find_first_of_set.

\par March 20, 2007 - Adobe "Apollo" WebKit Sources Released
\par
    Adobe "Apollo" is a platform for creating desktop apps using web technologies. Apollo will use
    the WebKit library to render HTML to an Apollo window. Our plan is to contribute our changes
    back to the WebKit community in the near future. We are working to get the code smoothly
    integrated into the WebKit source tree. We hope to make our contributions to the WebKit open
    source project soon. In the meantime, we are participating in the conversation at
    <http://webkit.org/contact.html>. So, if you have any questions or concerns, please email us at
    the "webkit-dev" mailing list.
\par Plans:
        - We hope to integrate our changes back into the WebKit source repository at webkit.org soon.
        - In the long term we expect that the WebKit shared library will not contain any platform specific code. For the near term, WebKit will have platform specific code to rasterize vector graphics generated by the HTML renderer to bitmaps. On OSX we use CoreGraphics and on Windows we use Cairo.
        - Source for WebKit with our modification can be found at <http://stlab.adobe.com/perforce/>.

On the morning of December 25, 2005, we lost a great friend and brilliant computer scientist. Grant Munsey joined Adobe in 1997 and convinced Adobe senior management that it was time the company started to give back to the open-source community. Among other achievements, he went on to found the original stlab.adobe.com web site. Through his efforts both Adobe and the community as a whole were changed for the better. In April 2001 Grant was struck by a serious illness from which he never fully recovered. For the foundation he laid and the basis upon which stlab.adobe.com stands, it is our honor to dedicate this release to him.

Please contact <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/sean_parent/">Sean Parent</a> with any and all comments (including those on how to improve the Adobe Source Libraries as they stand -- we need feedback, too!)

\par May 03, 2005 - ASL 1.0.3 Released
I'm pleased to announce the arrival of Adobe Source Libraries 1.0.3. This is mostly a maintenance release but it also boasts a small set of new features, including a threadsafe, context-sensitive string lookup system for internationalization/localization. There are also a slew of bug fixes that make this release well worth the download. Head over to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132417&package_id=145420">download</a> section and check it out.

\par April 01, 2005 - ASL 1.0.2 Released
The Adobe Source Libraries 1.0.2 is now available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132417">download</a>. Changes include a budding Win32 implementation of Adobe Begin, increased compiler compatibility, and extensive bug fixes and additions. The Win32 implementation of Adobe Begin does not have the same functionality as the Mac version, however it is in a place where it demonstrates the functionality of Adam and Eve well enough to warrant release.

\par March 07, 2005 - Adam Tutorial Posted
A command-line application that demonstrates Adam has been added to the CVS repository. The Adam tutorial will <i>not</i> build with the ASL 1.0.1 release; you must have the current state of the CVS repository to build it. For CVS help please see { deprecated }. The Adam tutorial has been tested to build with CodeWarrior, Darwin gcc (bjam), and MSVC.

\par February 25, 2005 - ASL 1.0.1 Preview Released
